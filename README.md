# boompad
Simple hackpad with 8 keys, an oled display, 4 Neo-LEDs, and an rotary encoder

### Inspiration
I simply wanted to kind of "max out" the hardware side of my hackpad, so I challenged myself to use the pins of the pico in the most efficient way

### Challenges
Using the correct measurements was a very difficult task, I had to redesign everything like 2-3 times until I finally noticed that my pcb was 4mm too big....
